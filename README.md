# Ada User Community Input

## What is Ada User Community Input?

The Ada User Community Input is a clearly defined **process** supported by appropriate infrastructure to facilitate Ada users from the community at-large to advocate new features for consideration by the ARG for possible inclusion to future revisions of the Ada language.

The UCI process defines a way for interested users to explore ideas, propose working groups, and collaborate on concrete language proposals that the ARG can formally deliberate on.

## Is this repository the official home of UCI?

Not exactly. This repository is only the community facing portion that tracks stage progression and handles community input for Stages I and II-final.

The Ada UCI process is developed and maintained by a dedicated ARG working group that aims to design a process that is platform independent and transparent.

## What is the Ada UCI Process?

The Ada UCI process applies to any given language change proposal that evolves through a three stage process.

### Stage I


All proposed changes and ideas begin in Stage I. The idea is to make the proposal of languages changes and new features as easy as possible, with the lowest possible barrier. Stage I is about presenting ideas, and discussing the merits and/or issues with those ideas among the community.

Valid proposals to Stage I are really any coherent idea for a change or new feature. This can be as small as a few sentences. The goal of Stage I is to have open debate and discussion about the proposal, and is not about developing a specific, formal proposal.

Discussions of Stage I should be open to all participants, and the discussion should remain visible to anyone.

Moderators, appointed by the ARG, will review and provide commentary on proposals that are similar to existing proposals, or Stage II Working Groups (Active or Disbanded).

If a proposal conflicts or compliments with an existing Stage I Proposal, Stage II Working Group, Stage III AI, or existing Ada feature, or is very likely to be rejected by the ARG (inappropriate for Ada), the moderators may decide to close a Stage I proposal. Previous closures of proposals can also serve as precedent for the closure of subsequent similar proposals.

The ARG UCI working group puts great importance on the reasonable consideration of all proposals, but at the same time, the moderators must consider proposals in the context of the ARG, including in the context of guiding design principals of Ada.

If a proposal is rejected, a quorum of no less than 5 users may petition for the ARG to directly consider the proposal, and make a final determination.

### Stage II

If a proposal from Stage I gains enough traction and maturity within the community, some number of members may coordinate with each other and propose to form a **working group** to formalize the proposal.

The working group proposal is put forward by creating a pull request for the addition of a *Stage II working group proposal* to the 'Active Working Groups' subdirectory of this repository.

The working group is then responsible for coordinating amongst themselves to work towards a formal proposal for consideration by the ARG.

The proposal should follow the official template (here) and should be submitted by the working group as a pull request to the 'Final Proposals' subdirectory.

This pull request will then be open to the community to make comments on. Depending on the comments, the working group may need to add commits to their pull requests to refine their proposal.


---
### Stage III

Once a Stage II proposal has been accepted and merged via the pull request described in Stage II, it will then be available for review and selection by the ARG.

The ARG may request that the working group clarify or modify parts of their final proposal, at which point the proposal regresses to Stage II, and the working group must submit a pull request for updates to the Final Proposal.
